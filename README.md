# Battery-Level-Notifier

Monitor the battery levels of your windows laptop and get critical alerts

External Library Installation required: Toast Notifier (python -m pip install win10toast)

While working on various projects, I would often lose track of time when focussed on the work at hand and the lack of a timely notification system from Windows 10 prompted me to create this python script to periodically alert me when the device was close to critical levels. 

This small project boosted the quality time I spent working on further projects without having to panic and scatter, looking for the device charger.

Additionally, it also alerts the user when the device has reached 100% battery life in order to avoid overcharging.
